A minimum value is specified that is the shortest interval for which correct operation of the digital circuit is guaranteed. |2 The hold time may have a negative value, in which case the minimum limit defines the longest interval (between the active transition and the application of the other signal) for which interval correct operation of the digital circuit is guaranteed.",
