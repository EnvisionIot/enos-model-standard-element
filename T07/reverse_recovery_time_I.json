	"description":"value of the reverse recovery time of a diode when switched from a specified forward current to a specified reverse current, at specified conditions.\nThe reverse recovery time is measured as the time interval between t_0, the point of switching from a forward current to a reverse current, and the instant when for decreasing values of i_R a line through the points for 0.9 I_RM and 0.25 I_RM crosses the zero current axis.\nAn alternative method for specifying the recovery value of i_R is to express it as a percentage (e.g. 10%) or as a specific measured value of the I_RM. The method used is normally described in the product specifying documentation.",
