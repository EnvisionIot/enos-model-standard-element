Content - The elements forming a permutation may be terminal identifiers or group identifiers but not a mixture of the two. A permutation must contain at least two elements. |Rule B2. Uniqueness - All elements within a permutation must be unique. A permutation may not contain groups that refer directly or indirectly to the same element. |Rule B3. Ordering - the order of elements within a permutation is not important.\nFor definition of terminal groups, see AAD171 and for definition of group names, see AAD172.",
