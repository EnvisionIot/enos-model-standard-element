	"description":"set of terminals and/or terminal groups on a component that may or may not have identical functions but which need to be grouped together for permutation or other purposes.\nThe group may consist of a set of terminals only or a set of other groups or any combination of terminals or groups, referenced by their names. |Groups are subject to the following rules : |Rule A1. Content - The elements forming a group may be terminal identifiers or group identifiers or any mixture of the two. A group must contain at least two elements. |Rule A2. Uniqueness - All elements within a group must be unique. A group may not contain groups that refer directly or indirectly to the same element. |Rule A3. Ordering - the order of elements within groups may be important. Where two or more groups are to be related in a permutation, then the elements within those groups must correspond across the groups. |Rule A4. Recursion - A group may not contain itself nor may it contain any group that refers directly or indirectly to itself.\nA group may be referenced by an application such as a simulator or a set of groups may be used to form a permutation (see AAD174).",
