	"description":"maximum non-repetitive peak reverse voltage of a rectifier diode or signal diode.\nNOTE - The repetitive voltage is usually a function of the circuit and increases the power dissipation of the device. A non-repetitive transient voltage is usually due to an external cause and it is assumed that its effect has completely disappeared before the next transient arrives.",
